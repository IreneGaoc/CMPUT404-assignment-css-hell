                I enjoy participating in a group, sharing my ideas to team members, assisting the group leader, joking around the team and helping the member who fall behind. 
                As a group member, I never afraid to stand up and speak out my ideas, and never hesitate to ask when I met problems. 
                Additionally, I am a quick learner, with curiosity and desire to learn new skills. 
                When I got difficult tasks, I chose to separate them by the order of difficulties, first achieved the parts I was confidence about, 
                then finished the rest by consulting to the others, and combined to all the resources I could find. After finishing the task, 
                I summarized how I solved this and improve the skills I found I was weak at that part immediately.
